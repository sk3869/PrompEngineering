      <h2>Brutalism</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1950s–1970s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Brutalism emerged in postwar architecture as a response to social need and material honesty. Designers such as Alison and Peter Smithson emphasized exposed concrete, structural clarity, and an unpolished aesthetic that rejected decorative surfaces. The movement valued transparency of construction, revealing beams, joints, and textures as part of the visual language. In graphic design, Brutalism reappears as stark layouts, monospaced type, and raw HTML‑like interfaces that foreground structure over polish. Its influence persists in contemporary web design, where stripped‑down systems highlight hierarchy, function, and the underlying grid rather than stylistic embellishment.</p>

      <h2>Kinetic Typography</h2>
      <p class="date-range">20th Century–Present</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Kinetic typography refers to the use of animated or motion‑driven text to convey meaning, rhythm, and emphasis. Emerging from early film title design and later expanded through digital tools, it treats typography as a temporal medium rather than a static form. Designers manipulate scale, pacing, rotation, and spatial transitions to guide attention and reinforce narrative tone. Kinetic typography appears in film credits, advertising, motion graphics, and interactive interfaces, where movement clarifies hierarchy and emotional intent. Its principles parallel spoken language, using timing and gesture to shape how viewers interpret information across time.</p>

      <p class="card-meta confusion">

      <h2>Gestalt Principles</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1910s–Present</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Gestalt principles originate from early 20th‑century psychology, proposing that humans perceive visual information as organized patterns rather than isolated elements. Concepts such as proximity, similarity, closure, continuity, and figure–ground explain how viewers group shapes, interpret hierarchy, and resolve incomplete forms. Designers use these principles to structure layouts, guide attention, and create intuitive relationships between text and imagery. Gestalt theory underpins modern interface design, branding systems, and typographic composition, ensuring that complex information feels coherent. Its influence extends across disciplines because it describes universal perceptual tendencies rather than stylistic preferences.</p>
