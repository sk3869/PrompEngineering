# AGENTS.md — AI Instructions

> This file is your "master letter" to the AI. Everything the AI needs to know about your project goes here.
> You will write a version of this file for every project this semester.
>
> **For this assignment**, the audience and constraints are defined for you below.
> **For future projects** (Design Museum, Business Site, Portfolio), you'll define your own audience, tone, and constraints from scratch.

## Audience & Tone

<!-- WHY THIS IS SET: Museum labels target a specific reader. Defining audience
     prevents the AI from writing for the wrong context (too academic, too casual). -->

- **Audience:** Museum visitors with general interest in design (not experts)
- **Tone:** Authoritative but accessible. Think museum wall label — precise, confident, no fluff.
- **Reading level:** Educated adult, no jargon without context

## Hard Constraints

- **Word count per card:** 80–120 words
- **Number of cards:** 3 (Bauhaus, Swiss Style, Reaction)
- **Vocabulary tags per card:** exactly 5
- **Example links per card:** exactly 2 (must be real, working URLs)
- **Required elements per card:**
  - "Not to be confused with ___ because ___."
  - "I verified this by checking [source]."

## Banned Words

<!-- WHY THIS MATTERS: Vague words waste tokens and dilute meaning.
     In your Business Site project, you'll build a different banned list
     (e.g., banning "synergy," "leverage," "best-in-class"). -->

Do not use these vague words in any card:

- creative, innovative, revolutionary, iconic
- interesting, unique, beautiful, amazing
- game-changing, groundbreaking, cutting-edge
- basically, essentially, literally

Replace with specific domain vocabulary.

## Controlled Vocabulary

<!-- THIS IS YOUR JOB: Build this list during Exploration (Phase 1).
     Run the vocabulary prompt from the Prompt Pack, then SELECT the terms
     that are actually useful. Discard the rest. Aim for 15–25 terms.
     For the Design Museum, your team will build a shared vocabulary.
     For the Business Site, this list will include Cialdini, Maslow, archetype terms. -->

Use these terms. If a term is not on this list, define it before using it.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|

Vorkurs	Bauhaus foundation course teaching materials, form, and color
Brutalism	A raw, structural design approach emphasizing honesty, clarity, and exposed form
Kinetic Typography	Motion‑based or animated text used to direct attention and create emphasis
Gestalt Principles	Perception rules explaining how humans group, organize, and interpret visual information
Grid System	A modular layout structure used to organize typography and images
Typographic Hierarchy	The arrangement of type to signal importance and reading order
Asymmetric Layout	A composition that avoids symmetry to create dynamic balance
Functionalism	The principle that design decisions must serve a clear purpose
Modular Composition	A layout built from repeatable units or structural modules
Sans‑Serif Typography	Typefaces without decorative strokes, often used for clarity
Objective Communication	Design that prioritizes clarity and neutrality over personal expression
Post‑Grid Design	Layouts that intentionally break or distort the grid for expressive effect
Layered Composition	Overlapping visual elements to create depth or tension
Visual Rhythm	Repetition or pacing of elements to guide the viewer’s eye
Form Follows Function	The idea that the purpose of an object should dictate its design
Abstraction	Reduction of form to basic shapes, colors, or structures
Material Honesty	Showing materials as they are, without decoration or disguise
Photographic Precision	Use of clean, high‑contrast photography for clarity and accuracy

*Aim for 15–25 terms total. Build this list during your Exploration phase.*

## Verification Rule

If you are unsure about any fact, date, attribution, or claim: write **VERIFY** instead of guessing. I will check it myself.

Do not invent quotes. Do not fabricate anecdotes. Do not attribute ideas to people without sourced evidence.
