## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1.  a little python coding
2.  I use ai alot to research, so I will have experience in using it efficiently as possible
3. a little java coding

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1. Professional methods to prompt AI
2. Great experience in code to understand what the AI is doing
3. How LLMS's work

## VOCABULARY I NEED BEFORE I CAN WRITE

```
List the domain terms you need to learn.
If you cannot define it in one sentence, you do not know it yet.
```

1. Brutalism
2. Kinetic typography
3. Gestalt principles

Central Idea: Prompt Engineering as a Design Discipline

• Prompting = shaping model behavior through structured inputs
• System prompts establish constraints, tone, and boundaries
• User prompts define goals, tasks, and context
• Examples (few-shot) teach the model patterns
• Constraints reduce ambiguity and prevent drift
• Brutalism = design clarity through raw, unpolished structure → useful for prompt minimalism
• Kinetic Typography = motion-based emphasis → parallel to how prompts guide attention
• Gestalt Principles = perception rules → help structure prompts for clarity and grouping
• Strong CTAs = clear action + clear value + clear audience
• Curator Cards = internal documentation that preserves design intent
• Evaluation loop → refine → test → iterate



## PINNED: VOCABULARY

```
Source: AI-generated via Prompt Pack > Controlled Vocabulary prompt.
Keep only the terms you will actually use. Kill the rest.
```

Brutalism — a raw, structural design approach emphasizing honesty and clarity.
Kinetic Typography — animated or motion-based text used to direct attention.
Gestalt Principles — rules of visual perception that explain grouping and hierarchy.




## PINNED: CONFUSIONS AND BOUNDARIES

Pin the distinctions that surprised you or corrected you.
```

• I used to think Brutalism was only an architectural style, but now I see how its raw, structural clarity applies to prompt design.
• I thought kinetic typography was just a motion graphics trick, but it’s actually about directing attention — similar to how prompts guide model focus.
• I assumed Gestalt principles were only for visual design, but they also help structure prompts so the model understands grouping and hierarchy.
• I didn’t realize how much system prompts control behavior — I thought user prompts were the main driver.
• I thought CTAs were just buttons, but strong CTAs are strategic communication tools tied to audience psychology.

## DECISIONS

| Decision | Your Answer |
|---|---|
| Card 3 movement | [New Wave / Grunge — pick one, say why] |

New Wave — because it breaks the rigid structure of Swiss Style and aligns with kinetic, expressive, experimental energy similar to kinetic typography.

| Expert for critique | [Name — say why this expert for this card] |

A UX Writer / Content Strategist — because this assignment is about clarity, structure, and communication, and UX writers specialize in shaping language for user understanding.

## THINGS I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT

```
After research, what did you reverse on? If nothing, you were not
paying attention or you already knew everything. Pick one.
```

I used to think Gestalt principles were only for visual layout, but now I understand they also help structure prompts so the model interprets information in the right groups.
