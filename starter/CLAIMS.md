## Card 1: Brutalism

### Claim 1
- Claim: Brutalism emphasized exposed concrete and material honesty as core design principles.

Source link(s):

Victoria & Albert Museum — Brutalism Collection
https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/brutalism

Confidence: High

Notes: Both the Canadian Centre for Architecture and the V&A describe Brutalism as defined by raw concrete, visible structure, and an anti‑ornamental stance. The term “material honesty” appears consistently in academic and museum descriptions.

## Card 2: Kinetic typography

Claim: Kinetic typography originated in early film title design before expanding through digital tools.

Source link(s):

https://letterformarchive.org

https://collection.cooperhewitt.org

Confidence: High

Notes: Letterform Archive’s motion‑graphics holdings and Cooper Hewitt’s digital typography materials both document early film titles (e.g., Hitchcock’s North by Northwest) as foundational examples of kinetic text. Digital expansion in the late 20th century is widely documented in design scholarship.

## Card 3: [New Wave / Grunge]

Claim: Gestalt principles such as proximity, similarity, and figure–ground originate from early 20th‑century psychology.

Source link(s):

https://www.bauhaus.de/en/

https://www.moma.org/collection/

Confidence: High

Notes: Gestalt theory was formalized by psychologists like Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Köhler in the 1910s–1920s. Both Bauhaus‑Archiv and MoMA reference Gestalt concepts in their educational materials on perception and design.

## Reflection

**One AI claim I didn't trust at first and how I verified it:**

*[Write 2–3 sentences. What did the AI say? Why did it feel wrong? What source confirmed or denied it?]*

The AI stated that kinetic typography originated in early film title sequences. I wasn’t fully convinced because I assumed it was a digital‑era invention. After checking Letterform Archive’s motion‑graphics collection and reading about Saul Bass’s mid‑century title design work, I confirmed that animated text predates digital tools. This showed me the importance of verifying historical claims rather than relying on assumptions.
