## Prompt 1

    exploration
    concept map

    What I sent : 
    Create a concept map showing how these three design concepts relate to each other:
1. Brutalism
2. Kinetic Typography
3. Gestalt Principles



Show: core principles, how each concept structures visual communication, and how they differ in intention. Use plain text with indentation — no images.


```
[Paste the prompt you used here]
```

- **What I got back (summary):**

The AI returned a structured concept map that separated each term by its design function: Brutalism as a structural/aesthetic approach, Kinetic Typography as a temporal communication method, and Gestalt Principles as perceptual rules. It also highlighted how these concepts intersect in hierarchy and viewer attention. Some connections were too abstract, so I refined them.


- **What I did with it:**

I extracted the clearest relationships and added them to CURATOR_NOTES.md. I discarded the overly theoretical parts and used the remaining structure to guide my controlled vocabulary and the tone of my curator cards.

## Prompt 2

    production
    draft curator cards

    What I sent: 

    Using my AGENTS.md, write 3 Curator Cards for:
- Brutalism
- Kinetic Typography
- Gestalt Principles

Each card must follow:
- 80–120 words
- Museum-label tone
- Exactly 5 vocabulary tags
- 2 real museum/archival links
- “Not to be confused with…” line
- Accountability note

Use ONLY my controlled vocabulary terms.

```

- **What I got back (summary):**

The AI produced three full museum‑label cards with correct tone, structure, and vocabulary. The content was strong, but I had to replace placeholder links with real museum sources and adjust a few sentences to stay within the 80–120 word limit. The tags and confusion lines were correct, and the accountability notes followed the required format.

- **What I did with it:**

I edited the cards for accuracy, replaced links with verified museum archives, and pasted the final versions into index.html as my three Curator Cards.

## Prompt 3 
Critique
Weingart

What I sent : 

Review my Curator Card about Kinetic Typography as if you were Wolfgang Weingart.

Using only Weingart’s documented positions:
1. What would he praise?
2. What would he challenge?
3. Is the vocabulary appropriate?
4. What is missing?

If unsure about a fact, write VERIFY.
Do not invent quotes or anecdotes.

Kinetic typography refers to the use of animated or motion‑driven text to convey meaning, rhythm, and emphasis. Emerging from early film title design and later expanded through digital tools, it treats typography as a temporal medium rather than a static form. Designers manipulate scale, pacing, rotation, and spatial transitions to guide attention and reinforce narrative tone. Kinetic typography appears in film credits, advertising, motion graphics, and interactive interfaces, where movement clarifies hierarchy and emotional intent. Its principles parallel spoken language, using timing and gesture to shape how viewers interpret information across time.

Examples:  
• Cooper Hewitt — Digital Typography Collection
• Letterform Archive — Motion Graphics Holdings
Not to be confused with New Wave Typography, because kinetic typography relies on motion over time, while New Wave experiments with static spatial disruption.
Accountability: I verified historical origins using Letterform Archive’s motion‑graphics materials.
```

- **What I got back (summary):**

The critique said Weingart would appreciate the expressive qualities and attention to typographic rhythm, but he would challenge the card for focusing too heavily on digital motion graphics instead of analog experimentation. It also noted that Weingart would expect more emphasis on spatial disruption and typographic counter‑structure. The critique helped clarify the distinction between kinetic motion and New Wave’s static experimentation.

- **What I did with it:**
I revised the Kinetic Typography card to better distinguish motion‑based emphasis from New Wave disruption. I kept the core definition but clarified the historical lineage and removed anything that implied Weingart worked with digital tools. I logged the changes in this file.

## IMPLEMENTING FEEDBACK

Kinetic Typography (20th Century–Present)  
Kinetic typography uses motion‑driven text to convey emphasis, rhythm, and narrative tone. Emerging from early film title design, it treats typography as a temporal medium shaped by pacing, scale shifts, and spatial transitions. While often associated with digital motion graphics, its expressive intent parallels earlier analog experimentation that challenged static typographic norms. Designers use movement to clarify hierarchy, guide attention, and create emotional resonance across time‑based media. Unlike New Wave Typography, which disrupts structure through spatial tension and fragmentation, kinetic typography relies on motion itself to shape meaning.

Not to be confused with New Wave Typography, because kinetic typography communicates through time‑based motion rather than static spatial disruption.
Accountability: I verified historical origins using Letterform Archive’s motion‑graphics materials.

## Changes 

I revised the card to clarify the distinction between kinetic typography’s time‑based motion and New Wave Typography’s spatial disruption, which the critique emphasized. I removed any implication that Weingart worked with digital animation and added a line acknowledging analog experimentation as a conceptual predecessor rather than a direct historical link. I kept the vocabulary consistent with my controlled list while adjusting the framing to better reflect Weingart’s documented positions.
